# Project title

This project is about unsupervised sense clustering of translations. It is a subfield of machine translation and 
used there in order to improve or evaluate word translations.

## Motivation, method, hypotheses

A bit more detail on why the problem is interesting,
initial ideas on what methods could be useful,
what are the expectations, and how to test the resulting
systems/models.

## Relevant literature 

A short list of literature (articles/books/blog posts/...). We will
pick some of the listed papers for further class discussion.
